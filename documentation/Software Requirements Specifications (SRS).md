```

This data model supports the core functionality of Excel across all platforms (Windows, macOS, web, and mobile), ensuring consistency and interoperability.

## DATA STORAGE

Excel's data storage strategy is designed to support large-scale operations while ensuring data integrity, security, and accessibility across platforms.

### Storage Architecture

1. Local Storage:
   - Desktop applications (Windows and macOS) use a proprietary file format (.xlsx) for local storage.
   - Mobile applications use a combination of the .xlsx format and a local database (SQLite) for offline functionality.

2. Cloud Storage:
   - Microsoft Azure Blob Storage is used for storing workbooks in the cloud.
   - Azure Cosmos DB is utilized for storing metadata, user information, and collaboration data.

### Data Retention

1. Version History:
   - The system maintains the last 100 versions of each workbook or 30 days of history, whichever is greater.
   - Older versions are automatically archived to cold storage after 90 days.

2. Deleted Items:
   - Deleted workbooks are moved to a "Recycle Bin" and retained for 30 days before permanent deletion.
   - Administrators can recover deleted items within this period.

### Redundancy and Backup

1. Geo-Redundancy:
   - All cloud data is replicated across multiple geographic regions using Azure's geo-redundant storage.

2. Backup Schedule:
   - Full backups are performed weekly.
   - Incremental backups are performed daily.
   - Transaction logs are backed up every 5 minutes.

3. Backup Retention:
   - Daily backups are retained for 30 days.
   - Weekly backups are retained for 3 months.
   - Monthly backups are retained for 1 year.

### Recovery

1. Point-in-Time Recovery:
   - The system supports point-in-time recovery for the last 30 days.

2. Disaster Recovery:
   - A disaster recovery site is maintained in a separate geographic region.
   - Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 4 hours
   - Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 15 minutes

3. Self-Service Recovery:
   - Users can restore previous versions of their workbooks through the Excel interface.

## DATA PROCESSING

Excel's data processing capabilities are designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently while maintaining security and integrity.

### Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates the high-level data flow within the Excel ecosystem:
