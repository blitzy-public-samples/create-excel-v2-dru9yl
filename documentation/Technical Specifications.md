    R[Undo/Redo Stack] --> D
    S[Data Validation] --> D
    T[Formatting Engine] --> D
    U[Cross-Platform Compatibility Layer] --> B
    U --> C
```

This data flow diagram shows how information moves through the various components of Microsoft Excel. User input enters through the UI Layer, which interacts with the Application Layer. The Application Layer coordinates with the Core Spreadsheet Engine for basic spreadsheet operations, the Data Analysis Module for advanced analysis, and the Visualization Engine for creating charts and graphs.

Data can be stored locally or in the cloud through the File I/O Module. The Add-in Framework, Collaboration Services, and Security and Compliance Module all interact with the Application Layer to provide extended functionality, real-time collaboration, and ensure data protection respectively.

The Core Spreadsheet Engine contains several sub-components, including the Calculation Engine, Formula Parser, Cell Manager, and others, which work together to handle the fundamental spreadsheet operations.

The Cross-Platform Compatibility Layer ensures that data and functionality are consistent across different platforms and devices.

This architecture allows for efficient data processing, scalability, and the flexibility to add new features and integrations while maintaining the core spreadsheet functionality that users expect from Microsoft Excel.
